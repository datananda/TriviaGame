# Women in Computing Trivia Game

Test your knowledge of women in computing as the game takes you through time from the very first computer program (developed by a woman!) to the current state of women in technology.

You will have 30 seconds to answer each question. After your response is logged, you will receive a brief educational blurb about the correct answer to the question. When you run out of questions, you will see a summary of your performance: how many questions you answered correctly, incorrectly, or ran out of time to answer.
